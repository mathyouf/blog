### I realize I can apply my positive philosophy of networking to my negative philosophy on fundraising.

## Networking

People say they dislike networking. I like meeting people with similar interests. I especially like meeting them in events where I could have a chance to work together with them on those interests, or discuss them in depth. Hackathons are great. Academic conferences are great.

I don't like trade-shows. This is a place where people try to coerce you into caring about something you don't, often people paid to do so who don't even care themselves. The best kind of person you can meet there is someone genuinely passionate about what they're working on, and it's a nice bonus if you are also passionate about it.

Better yet, for all of the above, is if you enjoy interacting with them, because it means you could get a chance to do it more, and maybe get a chance to make something in this world larger and better before you die than you could've without them.

Best yet, is if you love them as people. The world is only worth existing in because there are any people (however few for you) you can love.

If you hate networking, you probably just suffer from a lack of strategies to avoid the bad, and a lack of graditude for the good.

## Fundraising

I hate the concept. Viscerally. I dislike the kind of people who are brought into this world, especially the smart ones, and the only thing they can think to do with that gift of life is to get money. I think if the world ends, it'll be those kind of people who do it.

Interestingly, I think if the world progresses, some of them will also be a major reason for it.

But without them, every other living thing on the planet besides humans and dogs (wolves with Williams Syndrome) would probably be better off.

I'm starting to consider how wrong I might be about hating it. 

People needs homes, and food, and internet, at the very least, to do anything. If we lived in the garden of eden I imagined in the previous sentence that would still be true.

They can obtain those buildings certain things in certain settings.

But wouldn't it be great if they could build the things they'd be truly best at building, with a group of people they'd be best at building it with, in a setting that is best?

Wouldn't it be great if they could do so indefinitely? If anyone who wanted to build that thing could do so indefinitely? Then realistically at some point that activity has to become profitable.
