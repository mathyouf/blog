#### Applying my positive view of networking to my negative view of fundraising.

## Networking

People say they dislike networking. I like meeting people with similar interests, especially when we have a chance to work together. Hackathons are great.

I mostly dislike trade-shows. People, often paid and dispassionate themselves, try to coerce you into caring about things. 

The best kind of person you can meet there is genuinely passionate about a thing you are also.

Better yet if you enjoy interacting, because it means you could get a chance to do it more, and to make something in this world better before you die than you could've without them.

Best is if you love them. The world is only worth existing in because there are any people you can truly love.

If you hate networking, you probably just suffer from a lack of strategies to avoid the bad, and a lack of graditude for the good, in it.

## Fundraising

I hate the concept. I dislike smart people who are brought into this world and the main thing they do with that gift of life is get money.

I think if humanity loses all its joy or existence, the actions of those kind of people will be primarily responsible.

Interestingly, I think if the world progresses greatly, some of them will also be a major reason for that.

But without them, every other living thing on the planet besides humans and dogs would probably be better off.

## Life Building

I'm starting to consider how wrong I might be about hating it. 

People needs homes, and food, and internet, at the very least, to do anything. If we lived in the garden of eden I imagined in the previous section that would still be true.

Wouldn't it be great if people could build the things they'd be truly best at building, with a group of people they'd be best at building it with, in a setting that is best?

Wouldn't it be great if they could do so indefinitely? If anyone who wanted to build that thing could do so indefinitely? Then realistically at some point that activity has to become profitable.

I hope to find the good people who are trying to reconfigure human activity towards better lives, and be greatful for them.
