#### Applying my positive view of networking to my negative view of fundraising.

## Networking

People say they dislike networking. I like meeting people with similar interests, especially when we have a chance to work together. Hackathons are great.

I mostly dislike trade-shows. People, often paid and dispassionate themselves, try to coerce you into caring about things. 

The best kind of person you can meet there is genuinely passionate about a thing you are also.

Better yet if you enjoy interacting, because it means you could get a chance to do it more, and to make something in this world better before you die than you could've without them.

Best is if you love them. The world is only worth existing in because there are any people you can truly love.

If you hate networking, you probably just suffer from a lack of strategies to avoid the bad in it, and a lack of graditude for the good.

## Fundraising

I hate the concept. I dislike smart people who are brought into this world and the main thing they do with that gift of life is get money.

I think if humanity loses all its joy or existence, the actions of those kind of people will be primarily responsible.

Interestingly, I think if the world progresses greatly, some of them will also be a major reason for that.

But without them, every other living thing on the planet besides humans and dogs would probably be better off.

## Life Building

People needs homes, and food, and internet, at the very least, to do anything. If we lived in the garden of eden I imagined in the previous section that would still be true.

Wouldn't it be great if people could build the things they'd be truly best at building, with a group of people they'd be best at building it with, in a setting that is best?

Wouldn't it be great if they could do so indefinitely? If anyone who wanted to build that thing could do so indefinitely? Then realistically at some point that activity has to become profitable.

I hope to find the good people who are trying to reconfigure human activity towards better lives, and be greatful for them.

### Longer Form

So this topic was precipiated by my reaction to a tweet I saw where someone was mocking the idea of going to a hackathon as a place where people pretend to not be networking. This was about the recent Scale AI hackathon. The take seemed a bit strange to me. I enjoyed the hackathon a LOT. I got to hang out with people I share interests with, and people with the level of passion to work on them over a weekend, and even the opportunity to actually get to find a few to work with directly on a project. You get tolearn a lot about people by seeing them ctually working and talking to the about what they're working on. You learn a lot about your craft too when you have to ackonowledge the daily grind and how uch one can really get done in a  single day.
