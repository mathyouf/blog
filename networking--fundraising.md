#### Applying my positive view of networking to my negative view of fundraising.

## Networking

People say they dislike networking. I like meeting people with similar interests, especially when we have a chance to work together. Hackathons are great.

I mostly dislike trade-shows. People, often paid and dispassionate themselves, try to coerce you into caring about things. 

The best kind of person you can meet there is genuinely passionate about a thing you are also.

Better yet if you enjoy interacting, because it means you could get a chance to do it more, and to make something in this world better before you die than you could've without them.

Best is if you love them. The world is only worth existing in because there are any people you can truly love.

If you hate networking, you probably just suffer from a lack of strategies to avoid the bad in it, and a lack of graditude for the good.

## Fundraising

I hate the concept. I dislike smart people who are brought into this world and the main thing they do with that gift of life is get money.

I think if humanity loses all its joy or existence, the actions of those kind of people will be primarily responsible.

Interestingly, I think if the world progresses greatly, some of them will also be a major reason for that.

But without them, every other living thing on the planet besides humans and dogs would probably be better off.

## Life Building

People needs homes, and food, and internet, at the very least, to do anything. If we lived in the garden of eden I imagined in the previous section that would still be true.

Wouldn't it be great if people could build the things they'd be truly best at building, with a group of people they'd be best at building it with, in a setting that is best?

Wouldn't it be great if they could do so indefinitely? If anyone who wanted to build that thing could do so indefinitely? Then realistically at some point that activity has to become profitable.

I hope to find the good people who are trying to reconfigure human activity towards better lives, and be greatful for them.

### Longer Form

So this topic was precipitated by my reaction to a tweet I saw where someone was mocking the idea of going to a hackathon as a place where people pretend to not be networking. This was about the recent Scale AI hackathon. The take seemed a bit strange to me. I enjoyed the hackathon a LOT. I got to hang out with people I share interests with, and people with the level of passion to work on them over a weekend, and even the opportunity to actually get to find a few to work with directly on a project. You get to learn a lot about people by seeing them actually working and talking to the about what they're working on. You learn a lot about your craft too when you have to acknowledge the daily grind and how much one can really get done in a  single day. You get to see how fast people can build stuff and how they do it. Unlike a trade show, you get to see how the bacon is made. Unlike a conference, you get to see them in the middle of making it.

So obviously, that person deciding to slap the label "networking" on it seemed to me to be spoiling all the fun for themselves. And it made me think, what would it take for me to feel the same way at this hackathon? Well, i'd have to have not avoided the people with the kind of negative behavior I associate with "networking" while doing it. Thankfully, I care an awful lot about finding, meeting, and connecting with great people, so I put a lot of effort into doing so, which meant deploying strategies to avoid the former.

Now i've realized, wait, Matt, wtf. You always say you hate fundraising. Yes, I'd had this convo with a friend the day after the hack, just how much I despise it. Then I realized, maybe i'm making the same mistake as the networking person.

So what would I have to change? I'd have to look for the kind of people who are trying to provide a good life for others. Give them the opportunity to work on what they'd be great at making, and are passionate about making. Who know how to build it and can create an environment to do that, with just a bit of help to cover the costs of doing that. But of course they'd be reasonable to say that that activity needs to eventually find a way to sustain itself. And I suppose it's also reasonable they at least get the money back, so they can do that for others. And it's also reasonable that if everyone in the enterprise starts profiting, then they ought to as well.

I think those types of great people are likely semi-rare. But perhaps I should care about finding and meeting them as much as I do finding and meeting the people I love to find and meet when networking, and should care enough about finding and meeting them that I go to events where there might be "the other kind" of people that I don't like, and simply employ strategies to avoid them, and not let their pressence be what dictates my feelings about the entire opportunity, and be very greatful when I do meet those kind of people, just for them even to exist (just as I am when I meet genuinely passionate people who are builders).

So, there's my thoughts on the matter, hope this helps someone else as well!
